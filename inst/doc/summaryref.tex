\section{\texttt{summary()}: Numerical Summaries of Balance Diagnostics}

\subsection{Usage}

The \texttt{summary()} command returns numerical summaries of balance
diagnostics.
\begin{verbatim}
summary(object, interactions = FALSE, addlvariables = NULL, ...)
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Arguments}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{object}, which is the output from {\tt matchit()}.
\item \texttt{interactions}, which is an option to calculate summary
  statistics in \texttt{sum.all} and \texttt{sum.matched} for all
  covariates, their squares, and two-way interactions when
  \texttt{interactions = TRUE} and only the covariates themselves when
  \texttt{interactions = FALSE} (default).
\item \texttt{addlvariables}, which may contain additional variables
  on which to calculate the diagnostic statistics (in addition to the
  variables included in the matching procedure).  By default,
  \texttt{addlvariables = NULL}.  \texttt{addlvariables} must be
  specified as a data frame, with the same number of units and units
  in the same order as in the data set sent to \MatchIt .
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Outputs}

The output from the \texttt{summary()} command includes the following
elements, when applicable:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The original assignment model call.
\item \texttt{sum.all} is a data frame that contains variable names
  and interactions down the row names, and summary statistics on
  \emph{all observations} in each of the columns.  The columns in
  \texttt{sum.all} contain \footnote{The output for full matching is
    slightly different from that described here; see Section
    \ref{subsubsec:full} for details.}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item means of all covariates $X$ for treated and control units,
    where \texttt{Means Treated}$= \mu_{X|T=1} = \frac{1}{n_1}
    \sum_{T=1} X_i$ and \texttt{Means Control}$= \mu_{X|T=0} =
    \frac{1}{n_0} \sum_{T=0} X_i$,
  \item standard deviation in the treated group for all covariates $X$,  
        $\quad s_{x|T=1} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i \in \{i: T_i=1\}}
        X_i - \mu_{X|T=1}}{n_1-1} }.$
  \item summary statistics from a Q-Q plot, which compares treated and
    control covariate distributions, where \texttt{QQ Med}, \texttt{QQ
      Mean}, and \texttt{QQ Max} indicate the median, mean, and
    maximum orthogonal deviations from the 45 degree line of a Q-Q
    plot.
  \item standardized bias statistics, $${\rm Std.
      Bias}=\frac{\mu_{X|T=1} - \mu_{X|T=0}}{s_{x|T=1}}.$$
  \end{itemize}
  
\item \texttt{sum.matched} is a data frame which contains variable
  names down the row names, and summary statistics on only the
  \emph{matched observations} in each of the columns.  Specifically,
  the columns in \texttt{sum.matched} contain the following
  elements\footnote{The values output for full matching are slightly
    different from that described here; see Section \ref{subsubsec:full}
    for details}:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item weighted means for matched treatment units of all covariates
    $X$ and their interactions, where \texttt{Means Treated}$=
    \mu_{wX|T=1} = \frac{1}{n_1} \sum_{T=1} w_iX_i$ and \texttt{Means
      Control}$=\mu_{wX|T=0} = \frac{1}{n_0} \sum_{T=0} w_iX_i$,
  \item weighted standard deviations in the matched treated group 
   for all covariates $X$, where \texttt{SD} $= 
    s_{wX} =
    \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i} (w_iX_i - \overline{X}^*)^2}$, where
    $\overline{X}^*$ is the weighted mean of $X$ in the matched treated group.
  \item standardized bias statistics \texttt{Std.
      Bias}$=\frac{\mu_{wX|T=1} - \mu_{wX|T=0}}{s_{x|T=1}}$, and
  \end{itemize}
  where $w$ represents the vector of \texttt{weights}.
  
\item \texttt{reduction} shows the percent bias reduction achieved in
  each of the balance measures in \texttt{sum.all} and
  \texttt{sum.matched}, defined as $100(|a|-|b|)/|a|$, where $a$ was
  the value of the balance measure before matching and $b$ is the
  value of the balance measure after matching.  Because the difference
  in means and the standardized bias differ only by a constant (the
  standard deviation in the full treated group), the percent reduction
  in bias is the same for these two measures, and thus is only printed
  out once.

\item \texttt{nn} gives the sample sizes in the full and matched
  samples and the number of discarded units, by treatment and control.
  
\item \texttt{q.table} is an array that contains the same information
  as \texttt{sum.matched} by subclass.
  
\item \texttt{qn} gives the sample sizes in the full and matched
  samples and the number of discarded units, by subclass and by
  treatment and control.
\item \texttt{match.matrix} from the {\texttt matchit} output.
\end{enumerate}
