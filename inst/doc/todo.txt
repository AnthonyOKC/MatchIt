MatchIt: Working to do list 

Last updated: February 18, 2004


------------------------


I.  PROGRAMMING -------------------------------

(1) Improve output for summary(matchit.object)
	- Problematic covariates: output only if t-stat > 2
	- Make verbose option (T=list all covars, squares, interactions; F=only covars)

(2) Change output of matchit.object to make it easier to conduct diagnostics 
	- include actual vector of treatment

(3) Fix subsetting, such that subset command can take an input specified from the data frame

(4) Create new function (matched.data()?) that will output the full data set with only the
	matched units

(5) Print out warnings if
	- someone chooses exact=TRUE and also specifies nearest neighbor
	  options like mahal, caliper, ratio (exact=TRUE will take precedence so
 	  the other options will be ignored)  [DONE, EAS 2/21/04]
	- someone tries to do plot(foo) where foo was created using exact matching.
	  The plots don't make sense in that case so we should just print out a 
	  sentence saying that, instead of outputting the plots. [DONE, EAS 2/21/04]

(6) In plot() allow someone to choose to plot the mahvars and exact matching variables; currently it
	only asks about the variables in the main model specification [DONE in a rough way, EAS, 2/21/04]


II. DOCUMENTATION -------------------------------

(1) Address comments (denoted by "**")

(2) Exact restriction example in pscore matching sectiopn should have two variables -- take this out

(3) In "non-matched and discarded units", shorten FALSE output for observations

(4) place matchdef() example in appendix

(5) Remove Table 3

(6) Example of how to diagnose matchit model (Liz)

(7) Include instructions on how to analyze matched data (with and without Zelig)
        (a) without Zelig:
                (1) neyman() function -- very basic estimate
		(2) by subclass neyman
		(3) exact matching with neyman
                (4) linear regression for matched data
	(b) with Zelig: 
		(1) Simple D&H
		(2) by subclass
		(3) fitting models separately in T and C groups

(8) Psweights, psclass, pscores

(9) make code pretty

(10) Demo script

(11) Make program consistent -- internal objects vs. external objects

(12) document match.data() function (documentation in 3.4 and example section, df includes pscore/psclass/etc.)

(13) change counter

III. APPLICATIONS -------------------------------

(1) Carpenter - try multiple defns of treatments
	- Zelig survival models? 


IV.  MUCH LONGER TERM -----------------------------

(1) Linking in Ben Hansen's optimal matching code
