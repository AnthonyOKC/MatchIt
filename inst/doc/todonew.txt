# To-do list generated from July 10, 2003 meeting with Gary, Kosuke, Dan, Liz

# Allocation of to-do items (also entered in todo.txt)

1.  Global change of "match" -> "matchit"
	Not allocated; volunteers?

Liz: 
2.  Fixing exact option 
	Change so that exact=TRUE (use all variables in model formula, don't do pscore)
			    =FALSE (no exact matching)
			    =vector of variables (do exact matching on these, then pscores
						  within)
	Check if can use "covariates" from model output (for various types of model spec.)
	Check what happens with interactions

3.  General troubleshooting/diagnosing/adding error messages
	Items A(1), C(6,7,8,9) on todo.txt
	Other general troubleshooting: run program many different ways, see what happens!
	If n_t or n_c < 2 in a subclass, don't run output for that subclass

Dan:
4.  (Rough) write up of discussion we had today about variance estimation

5.  Fix up write-up in cupid.tex
	Change order of examples: exact matching first
	Make early examples and demo very simple (just a few variables)
	Make documentation simpler

Kosuke:
6.  Incorporate Zelig for analysis portion

7.  Add generalized additive model option

8.  Split "diagnose" into "subclassify" and "plot" commands to be run on
	output of balance()
	This maybe should wait until after I diagnose diagnose  
	The other thing that needs to be done here is figure out how to calculate
		the variances of the X's when matching is done with ratios and
		there are variable numbers of matches per treated.  (Kosuke,
		I can help with this...Paul Rosenbaum's work on full matching
		might have some ideas)
