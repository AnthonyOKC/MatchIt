Subject: Your Paper with Political Analysis

Dear Gary et al.,

We have three reviews on your manuscript and I have had a chance to give the
paper a close reading myself.  R1 and R3 are from the first round.  R4 is
new.  The delay in the processing is much more due to variables at work in
the Political Analysis office and not tardiness on the part of reviewers.

It is important to get this paper right with the correct pitch because it
will be widely read. The reviewers are impressed with the work but also
express varying degrees of unhappiness or frustration.    In attitude I am
in agreement with R1, although I am not necessarily committed to all of
R1~Rs interpretations.  R1~Rs review I see as the most useful, although the
others definitely have important things to say that should be helpful in
making further revisions.    The decision itself, as I already signaled is
another R&R round.   I probably would not send the paper back to R3 or R4
(or back to R2), but I could envision calling upon R1 once again if further
help is needed.

.  My major suggestion is to consider R1 as your primary audience for the
next revision.  That does not mean that you do everything R1~Rs way.
Rather, where R1 needs convincing, supply the argument that closes the deal.

As I see it there is a lot to like about the paper.  Occasionally one comes
across a paragraph with dazzling insights.   The caveats about confounding,
etc., on page 6 are well worded.     While I have no ax to grind regarding
matching, I want this paper to succeed.  Some comments:

Although the remedy is clear (pre-processing is good), the nature of the
model-dependence problem seems unfocused.  Is it the subjectivity derived
from too many available independent variables?  (e.g., the abstract)
Nonlinearity?  (e.g., Figure 1)  Ignoring the many possible interaction
effects? (e.g., the Koch discussion).  Also, if model selection is the
problem, one might be left with the view that matching is no less
subjective.

The paper could also provide a clearer perspective as to what is new and
what is not (at least to those familiar to the central literature on
matching and proximity scores).    My image of the literature is that it is
a bit unsettled (e.g., Imbens 2004), with both conventional wisdom plus
debate about the details.  Where in all this does your paper fit in?  E.g.,
would Rubin et al. see your central argument about preprocessing as standard
recommendation, something novel, or somewhere in between?

I seem to have missed the argument why post-matching parametric analysis
makes things better.  With good matching, couldn~Rt a further round of
parametric analysis make things worse by simply burning precious degrees of
freedom?   With pre-processing, model selection may be no problem  (a
virtue), but then (the paradox) why is it needed?  Discuss.

Would not the requirement for plausible matches (particularly within the
convex hull) strike a death blow to regression-discontinuity analysis, which
is a current rage?

I agree with R2 that the appendix on ecological inference can be abandoned.

The one section that really needs work is the set of two examples­Carpenter
and Koch.  If I understand what is going on, the graphs in Figures 2 and 3
are strikingly misleading.  They show that the parametric analysis performed
with a pre-processed set of all possible models yields strikingly less
variance than the same set of all possible models without pre-processing.
Should there be any surprise in this?   Am I correct that the ~Sraw~T data
consists of all possible estimates of beta averaged over all possible models
with no weighting (e.g., model averaging based on a flat prior rather than
posterior model averaging)?  Of course the coefficient of interest will vary
all over the place if essential control variables (necessary for reducing
bias) are all present in only half the models.  Do I misunderstand?  Can the
point about low variance with pre-processing be made without seemingly being
misleading?

In other ways, the Carpenter and Koch discussions are confusing.  How is
this Carpenter-data matching done, given the convex-hull problems?  Is there
some intuition about where the new result comes from?  On Koch, what exactly
is the hypothesis­that knowing a candidate makes one think of them as more
conservative, controlling for objective knowledge?  Where, if anywhere, is
the surprise in this analysis?

I hope this is clear and sufficient direction.  I am sure you will succeed
in figuring out the best course.  If you have questions, please feel free to
call on me.  I look forward to the next iteration.

Best,

Bob
