# MatchIt: Nonparametric Preprocessing for Parametric Causal Inference

MatchIt selects matched samples of the original treated and control groups with similar covariate distributions -- can be used to match exactly on covariates, to match on propensity scores, or perform a variety of other matching procedures.  The package also implements a series of recommendations offered in Ho, Imai, King, and Stuart (2007) <[DOI:10.1093/pan/mpl013](https://doi.org/10.1093/pan/mpl013)>.
